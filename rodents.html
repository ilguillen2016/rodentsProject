       <p> Not all rodents were created equal, some rodents were raised to be snake food, others to be companions, and others to be lab rats. Choose your rodent wisely and feed it regularly. A fed rodent is a happy rodent. </p>

      <title> Not All Rats Eat Cheese</title>
      <p> There are many negative stereotypes in the rodent community, such as all rats eat cheese and that all rodents are small and fuzzy. Rats also eat fish, fruit, and grains. The largest rodent in the world is the Capybara, native to South America. Capybaras' are on average two feet tall and four feet wide, and weigh around 100 lbs.
